# Silent Empty Array Return in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in MATLAB: silently returning an empty array when a function fails to produce the expected result. This can lead to significant debugging challenges.

## Problem

The `myFunction` function in `bug.m` demonstrates the issue. Under certain conditions, it returns an empty array (`[]`) without any warning or error message.  This silent failure can cause downstream functions to crash or produce incorrect results without clear indication of the source of the problem.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function. It includes explicit error handling, issuing a warning or throwing an error if the expected value is not found. This allows for more robust error detection and debugging.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.m` and `bugSolution.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run the function with inputs that trigger the error condition. Note that the original function lacks any error indication while the corrected version provides explicit feedback.
